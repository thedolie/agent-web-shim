# indy-web-shim -- POC

This universal javascript library provides the necessary functionality to "pack" and "unpack" agent based wire
messages over the Sovrin defined protocol for agent messages. It is neccessary in order to read and 
write a wire message. The output of this library enables interoperability for agents to interact with
one another. This is a Typescript (backwards compatible with javascript) library intended to be consumed
by javascript enviornments running on the web, mobile platforms, desktop, and server.
